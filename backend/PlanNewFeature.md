# Plan a new Feature
make a plan for implementing a new feature. Take the following things into account:
- the feature is to inport an export data.
- the data is all about character data
    - descriptiv data
        - male, female
        - character class
        - size, age, social class, ...
        - ...
    - stats
        - St, Gw, In,...
        - ...
    - skills
    - spell
    - equipment
        - weapons
        - containers
        - transportation equipment
        - ...    
    - character history
        - learned skill and spells (date, costs, level)
        - gained expirience points or gold(date ,amount)
        - ...
- the import data can come from different systems and contain da data in different formats
- the import source may require tailored conversion into the common internal format (we refer to it as BMRT-Format)
- if all information is transformed into the BMRT-Format we want to check if the Skills, Spells, Equipment and other things are available in the Masterdata of the game system set by the import data.
    - link items with exisiting master data
    - add new items to masterdata 
    - OR mark item as personal Item (players house rules)
- later I want to add new formats 
    - new formats should be plugable. 
        - At best by droping a file into the right folder
        - Or by adding the new package and registering it on one location
- the export of the data must create ecactly the same output as we had in the input file
